### What I learned

From this project, I learnt how to use SCSS better and I learnt how to use less code. 
In the course of this project, I learnt how to nest my codes better and how to manipulate containers and the children objects within those containers.

### Continued development

I am very initrigued and intrested in IT, this stage in my life, I am more inclined to robotics and Artificial
Intelligence, In years to come, I hope to improve especially on those two parts of my skills.
